This cost will be deducted from the value of the refund.<br />\r\nAn alternate solution is an Sareewali Store Credit, which nullifies the Credit Card Commission charge and therefore makes it possible for us to issue a Store Credit equivalent to the final accepted value of creditable funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bank Transfers:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For orders placed using Bank Transfers, refunds would be issued only as Store Credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Local Taxes:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GST&nbsp;are borne directly by the customer as per local laws, to be paid at the time of delivery as advised by the respective courier partner.
